20   7627

That switch in the wall
worked; the door had been
unlocked.
10   1926

Bid I give up, and forget
euerthing I had done so
far?
9   1573

All I remembered at that
point was finding myself
alone.
8   1815

There was something hy my
feet.

ll flashlight...
5   1366

Oh...
Oh, my head...
Where was I? it was so
dark....
7   1063

A thin, grey mouse was
stuck in a trap. It looked
frantic but exhausted.

Did I free it?
13   2531

The mouse was dead;it
looked like the cat had got
to it.
11   1814

That house... where was I?
4   771

There was a body... lying on
the floor. Who was it?
9   1473

I didn't recognize his face.
he was still kind of warm
8   1580

the desk had a computer
and some papers on it, and
a single drawer. I didn't
want to snoop, but...

Did i open the drawer?
19   3503

Maybe it was better that I left the desk alone.
8   1497

Receipts, pens...
...and a blurry photo. looked
like a store of some kind.

Why did this look so
familiar?
15   3040

I really shouldn't have been 
going through this stuff,
getting my fingerprints
everywhere
11   3033

Blood on the wall... It
smeeld fresh, and
sickening.

I realized there was blood
on my shoes and pants.

Oh, man... I had to get
18   3431

out of there.
2   332

If that man died in the
hallway, what was the
blood doing there?
11   1973

I noticed that I limped as i
moved down the stairs.

How did I hurt my leg, I
wondred?

All i could really recall
was coming home, seeing
20   3932

Rachel. I was upset. She
looked afraid.

I shook my head and tried
to clear it. I knew I should
head downstairs, try to
find a way out.
20   3859

Did I give up, and forget
everthing I had done so
far?
9   1594

A collection of rusty tools.
These looked like they'd
seen a lot of use, and were
caked in amp-smelling
dirt.

Why weren't they in a
shed?
19   4027

This was an odd place to
keep yard tools.

What would they have been
used for in here?
15   2606

I found a picture of a
couple. It looked like it'd
been moved a lot; there
seemd to be a switch
behind it.

Did I push the switch?
18   3576

I didn't want to mess
around with everybody's
struff.
7   1701

It depressed smoothly into
the wall. I heard a faraway
click somewhere.
9   2250

The shelf was full of books
on local history and
hunting. Seemed like the
owner of the house really
knew the area.
19   3567

There were scribbles of all
kinds on random scraps of
paper, and notes about
some kind of water tower.
15   3115

Did he mean the one by the
old train yard?
8   1194

An old dining table covered
in dirty dishes for two
people.

There were dozens of beer
cans and other liquor
bottles among the dishes.
21   4346

The smell was turning my
stomach.
5   1088

How long had this been
here, rotting? the man
upstairs didn't look like
he'd been dead a long time.
18   3217

A black-and-white photo.
looked like the man
upstairs, and his wife, I
guessed. There was no
reason for me to keep this.

Did I take it?
20   4054

I figured this was no help to
me, so i left it behind.
7   1262

I slipped the photo into my
pocket. Maybe this would
help me find some answers.
12   2571

I lookd like hell. My clothes
were dirty and torn, and
there was mud caked all
over my shoes.
16   2724

Had i been sleepwalking
again? Was that how i got
to that house?
10   2073

The bathroom was spotless;
everything had been wiped
to a sheen

I wondered if it was the
man's wife who did the
cleaning, or him.
19   4035

There was a photo
development tray lying on
the floor. Some leftover
negatives were sticking
out, but they were pretty
blurry.
19   4294

I thought I saw what looked
like treetops.
6   1391

The front door was blocked
by a pile of furniture.

I knew i had to find another
way out.
13   2496

The door was taped up and
seemed to be stuck.

By the smell, I guessed it
led to the kitchen.
13   2489

I gave the door hard
shove and, to my surpise,
it cracked open.
9   1736

The box looked heavy, but
there were marks on the
floor. It had obviously been
moved before.
15   2933

Maybe I had found a way
out.

I must have move it, right?
10   1686

I left it alone, but I couldn't
think of another option.
7   1561

I heaved the box forward,
and it finally gave.
